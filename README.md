 Here's a brief description of the key components used:
 
 1.  QRCodeWriter: This is a class provided by the ZXing library that allows for the generation of QR codes. It has a encode method that takes in the text to be encoded, the barcode format (in this case, BarcodeFormat.QR_CODE), and the desired width and height of the QR code image as parameters.

2.   BitMatrix: This is a class provided by the ZXing library that represents the QR code as a matrix of bits. The encode method of QRCodeWriter returns an instance of BitMatrix that represents the QR code generated from the provided text and other parameters.

3.   qrCodeMatrix: This is a variable that stores the BitMatrix object returned by the encode method. It represents the QR code generated as a matrix of bits.

The generated QR code can be further processed or displayed as an image using other Java libraries or APIs. For example, you can save the BitMatrix as an image file using ImageIO class from Java's standard library, or display it in a graphical user interface using a library like Swing or JavaFX.
